## Audio-Following Robot Car
Team project (5 members)
Built an autonomous robot car that localizes and navigates toward sound sources at specific frequencies using embedded signal processing and motor control.

## My contributions:
- Designed and implemented a custom ADC for audio signal sampling
- Co-developed embedded control code for sound-based navigation
- Implemented PWM motor control and speed calibration logic
- Debugged system-level issues including noise sensitivity and motor drift

## Tech Stack
- Raspberry Pi / Microcontroller
- Analog filters (custom design)
- ADC implementation
- DC motors + motor driver

## Challenges & Engineering Decisions
- Frequency diffraction causing rear-source ambiguity
- Motor imbalance and calibration
- Noise rejection in real environments
