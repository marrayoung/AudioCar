## Autonomous Motion Requirements

The audio car is required to demonstrate basic autonomous motion by completing the following maneuvers:
- Drive in a straight line
- Drive in a square (twice)
- Drive in a figure-eight pattern (twice)

These motion patterns verify consistent motor control and repeatable movement behavior.
